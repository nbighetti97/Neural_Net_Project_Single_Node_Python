# Neural_Net_Python
As the last project for my Artificial Intelligence class, I managed to create a one layer neural net with three nodes in python from scratch, using libraries only for manipulating the data. The model reached up to 96% accuracy in predicting the total number of employees in mathematical and/or computer occupations for the year of 2021 based on 14 years worth of data. It was coded in jupter notebook, pulling the data from an excel file, and using well known libraries to pull math functions, and handle the data.
This project was inspired by my Data Analytics final dissertation where I show how the job market for Cybersecurity positions has only grown large since it was acknowledged as a new branch of computer science occupations and started being documented by the U.S. Bureal of Labor Statistics as oposed to other occupations within the same field where there is no growth or show to have a slight decrease in the total number of employees in the area for specific years.
A brief explanation on how the algorithm works is provided in the word document. Tracing the data is yet to be concluded and posted. This is only the beginning of the project. Another layer is yet to be implemented in the project as well to better digest the data, and find more precise results. Other functions and features are yet to be implemented, the priority here is to implement the second layer fisrt, and then other features.
