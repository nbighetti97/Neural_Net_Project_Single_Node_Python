# Neural_Net_Python
As the last project for my Artificial Intelligence class, I managed to create a one layer neural net with three nodes in python from scratch. The model reached up to 95% accuracy in predicting the total number of employees in mathematics and computer occupations for the year of 2021 based on 14 years of data.
